# CompTIA Cloud+ (CV0-004) Study Guide (Expanded)

## Domain 1: Cloud Architecture (23%)

### 1.1 Cloud Service Models
- **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service):**
  - Offers virtualized computing resources over the internet.
  - Examples: AWS EC2, Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines.
  - Use Case: Hosting applications, websites, or development environments.
- **PaaS (Platform as a Service):**
  - Provides a platform for building, testing, and deploying applications.
  - Examples: Google App Engine, Microsoft Azure App Service.
  - Use Case: Rapid development and deployment without managing infrastructure.
- **SaaS (Software as a Service):**
  - Fully managed software applications accessible via the internet.
  - Examples: Google Workspace, Dropbox, Salesforce.
  - Use Case: Collaboration tools, CRM, and productivity software.
- **FaaS (Function as a Service):**
  - Executes functions in response to events; focuses on serverless architectures.
  - Examples: AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions.
  - Use Case: Event-driven applications, microservices.

### 1.2 Disaster Recovery and Resource Planning
- **High Availability Strategies:**
  - Implement load balancers to distribute traffic.
  - Use geographic redundancy to minimize single points of failure.
- **Disaster Recovery Tiers:**
  - Tier 1: Data backup with minimal automation.
  - Tier 4: Fully automated failover with near-zero downtime.
- **Multicloud and Hybrid Models:**
  - Multicloud: Combines services from multiple cloud providers.
  - Hybrid: Bridges private and public cloud environments for flexibility.

---

### 1.3 Cloud Networking Fundamentals
- **Public and Private Connectivity:**
  - **Public Connections:** Accessed over the internet using VPNs or secure tunnels.
  - **Private Connections:** Dedicated links like AWS Direct Connect or Azure ExpressRoute.
- **Load Balancers:**
  - Distributes traffic across multiple servers for reliability.
  - Types: Application load balancers, network load balancers.
- **DNS in Cloud:**
  - Configures domain name resolution for cloud-hosted services.
  - Tools: AWS Route 53, Azure DNS.

## Domain 2: Deployment (19%)

### 2.1 Planning for Deployment
- **Capacity Planning:**
  - Analyze application demand to determine resource requirements.
  - Use scaling strategies (vertical and horizontal).
- **Deployment Strategies:**
  - **Rolling Deployments:** Gradual rollout with minimal downtime.
  - **Blue/Green Deployments:** Use separate environments for staging and production.
  - **Canary Deployments:** Deploy changes to a subset of users.

---

### 2.2 Storage and Compute Configuration
- **Block Storage:**
  - Optimized for databases and transactional workloads.
  - Example: AWS Elastic Block Store (EBS).
- **Object Storage:**
  - Used for unstructured data, backups, and archival storage.
  - Example: Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage.
- **Compute Instances:**
  - Choose instance types based on workload (e.g., general-purpose, compute-optimized).

---

## Domain 3: Operations (17%)

### 3.1 Cloud Monitoring
- **Key Metrics to Monitor:**
  - CPU and memory utilization.
  - Disk I/O and network throughput.
- **Monitoring Tools:**
  - AWS CloudWatch: Collect and monitor logs and metrics.
  - Prometheus and Grafana: Open-source monitoring and visualization.

---

### 3.2 Backup and Recovery Best Practices
- **Snapshot Management:**
  - Create snapshots for point-in-time recovery.
  - Automate snapshot schedules for consistent backups.
- **Backup Storage Tiers:**
  - Standard, infrequent access, archival storage.
  - Examples: Amazon Glacier, Azure Archive Storage.

---

## Domain 4: Security (19%)

### 4.1 Identity and Access Management
- **IAM Best Practices:**
  - Use roles instead of individual permissions.
  - Implement policies using JSON-based configurations.
  - Enable MFA for all privileged accounts.
- **Key Tools:**
  - AWS IAM, Azure AD, Google Cloud IAM.

---

### 4.2 Data Security in Cloud
- **Encryption:**
  - Encrypt data in transit using TLS/SSL.
  - Encrypt data at rest using cloud-native solutions.
  - Examples: AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault.
- **DLP (Data Loss Prevention):**
  - Prevent sensitive data leakage with automated policies.

---

## Domain 5: DevOps Fundamentals (10%)

### 5.1 CI/CD Pipelines
- **Pipeline Stages:**
  - **Build:** Compile and test code.
  - **Test:** Automated unit and integration testing.
  - **Deploy:** Deliver code to production or staging environments.
- **Tools:**
  - Jenkins, GitLab CI, CircleCI.

---

### 5.2 IaC Tools
- **Terraform:**
  - Manages cloud resources using code.
  - Example:
    ```hcl
    resource "aws_instance" "example" {
      ami           = "ami-12345678"
      instance_type = "t2.micro"
    }
    ```
- **AWS CloudFormation:** Declarative templates for cloud resource provisioning.

---

## Domain 6: Troubleshooting (12%)

### 6.1 Diagnosing Cloud Issues
- **Network Connectivity:**
  - Check security groups, firewalls, and routing tables.
  - Test connectivity using `ping` and `traceroute`.
- **Performance Bottlenecks:**
  - Analyze resource allocation (CPU, memory).
  - Use tools like AWS Trusted Advisor for recommendations.
- **Application Errors:**
  - Debug application logs.
  - Roll back deployments if necessary.
