# Laptop Hardware


## Laptop Hardware

* Engineered to precise specifications
    * A challenging repair
* Some laptops are easier to fix than others
    * An ongoing learning process
* Understand the process
    * The details will vary between laptop manufacturers 


## Laptop batteries

* The power source when unplugged
    * May be easily replaced or require a teardown
    * Five minutes vs one hour
* Lithium-Ion and Lithium-Ion polymer are common
    * No memory effect
    * Charging the battery diminishes capacity
* Different form factor for each laptop
    * Battery types and styles can vary
    * Battery technology is changing constantly

**Memory Effect** - also known as battery effect, lazy battery effect, or battery memory, is an effect observed in nickel-cadmium rechargeable batteries that causes them to hold less charge. It describes the situation in which nickel-cadmium batteries gradually lose their maximum energy capacity if they are repeatedly recharged after being only partially discharged. The battery appears to "remember" the smaller capacity.


## Laptop Keyboard

* The most used component of the laptop
    * Can be easy to replace
    * A few screws and a single ribbon cable
    * May not always be this simple
* Or connect an external USB keyboard
    * Not very portable, but works in a pinch


## Laptop keys

* Some repairs might require the replacement of a key cap
    * This can be a delicate procedure
* Check with the manufacturer's instructions
    * It's very easy to accidentally break the key cap or the components
      underneath


## Laptop memory

* Small Outline Dual In-line Memory Module (SO-DIMM)
* Memory used in laptops and mobile devices
    * Often easy to install and replace
* Some laptop memory is soldered to the system board
    * No upgrade available
    * Requires a full system board replacement


## Laptop storage

* Magnetic disk
    * Traditional spinning drive platters
    * 2.5 form factors (3.5 for desktops)
* SSD (Solid-State Drive)
    * All memory, no moving parts
    * Silent, fast access time, no latency
    * 2.5 inch form factors
* M.2 
    * Smaller form factor
    * No SATA data or power cables
    * Easy to install and replace


## Replacing laptop storage

* All internal
    * Open a cover on the back
    * Open the entire laptop
* Can be very modular
    * Two screws and the drive slides out
* M.2 drives are even easier
    * One screw
    * Similar to RAM installation


## Migrating from HDD to SSD

* An impressive upgrade
    * Move from spinning mechanical drive to solid state memory
* It's almost like getting a new laptop
* Install an OS on the SSD
    * Move user documents between drives
    * Install any required applications 
    * Can be time consuming
* Image/Clone the HDD
    * No OS installation required
    * Move everything from one to the other
* Imaging software needed
    * Sometimes included with the SSD
    * Many commercial and open source options
