A **brigand** is a bandit or outlaw, typically a member of a gang, who engages in robbery and plundering, especially in rural or remote areas. Historically, brigands operated in forests, mountains, or other difficult-to-police terrains where they could easily ambush travelers, merchants, or caravans. The term is often associated with highwaymen and other robbers who lived outside the law.

Brigands have been part of various cultures throughout history and are sometimes romanticized in literature and folklore. In some contexts, they were seen not just as criminals but also as rebels resisting oppressive authorities. However, their activities generally involved theft, violence, and disruption of local economies.
